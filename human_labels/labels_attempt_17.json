  "comments": "Suggestions on the Following Attempt: \nThe report is very interesting, especially the classification analysis of different cell types (Mitotic cells, apoptosis cells) as well as 4 cell phases. Continue along this line and try to quantize the percentage of all cell types as well as 4 cell phases in the imaging data. You could not only use feature based classification, but also use clustering based methods. In the end try to refine the cell cycle analysis plot to integrate both features distribution of each cell type, percentage of cell types in BIRC5 knockout, overexpression and control data. "
