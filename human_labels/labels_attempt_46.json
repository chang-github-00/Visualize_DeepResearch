  "comments": "Suggestions on the Following Attempt: \n  1. The ER channel is essential for understanding KIF3A perturbations. Currently, most conclusions have been drawn based on the significant increase in ER intensity. Try to measure more ER features to understand the behavior of KIF3A perturbations in a more fine-grained way. \n2. Multiple similar function genes are mentioned in the report. Try to compare their phenotype similarity and difference as well as the strength of dysfunction. Form pathway links and understanding with this analysis."
