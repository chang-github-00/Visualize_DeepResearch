  "comments": "What I’d adjust\n\n- Dial back “direct morphological evidence for Warburg effect.” Your data are consistent with VHL-loss metabolic reprogramming via HIF stabilization , but Cell Painting cannot by itself prove Warburg flux. Rephrase to:\n\n- “Reduced MitoTracker signal consistent with decreased mitochondrial mass and/or membrane potential, aligning with HIF-driven metabolic reprogramming.”\n\n- Be explicit about what “mitochondrial dysfunction” means here. MitoTracker intensity can drop from depolarization, less mass, or dye uptake differences. If you keep “dysfunction,” anchor it as proxy and propose OCR/ECAR, TMRE/TMRM, mito area/texture as validation.\n\n- Control matching is the biggest methodological risk. You list VHL KO from a CRISPR plate and a NegCon from a different plate/source. That can silently inflate organelle/intensity differences via batch/plate effects. Use same-plate CRISPR NegCon wells and ideally multiple VHL KO wells/guides.\n\n- Separate “content” vs “concentration” effects. With 54% smaller cell area, some mean intensity increases (ER/RNA edges) could reflect compaction rather than true upregulation. Prefer integrated intensity normalized by cell area, or compare organelle area/texture features.\n\nMinor factual sanity checks\n\n- “VHL aberrations in >90% of sporadic ccRCC” is a defensible statement in reviews (still worth phrasing as “majority/commonly, often cited as ~80–90%+” depending on cohort).\n\n- Belzutifan is indeed approved for VHL disease–associated RCC/CNS hemangioblastomas/pNET \nFDA Access Data.\n\n- VHL’s role in targeting hydroxylated HIF-α for degradation is correct .\n\n\n3 high-impact next experiments/analyses\n\n- Within-plate replication: redo all stats using matched CRISPR NegCon wells on the same plates; add additional VHL reagents if available.\n\n- Mechanistic triangulation: compare the VHL KO profile to hypoxia/PHD inhibition and HIF1A or EPAS1 perturbations; test belzutifan rescue as a morphological reversal assay.\n\n- Mito specificity: add mito area, count/fragmentation texture, and a potential-dependent dye control (TMRE/TMRM) to distinguish mass vs membrane potential."
