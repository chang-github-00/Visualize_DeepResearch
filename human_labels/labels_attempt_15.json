  "comments": "Suggestions on the Following Attempt: \n 1. The crucial claim is that GFM1 knockout causes Mitochondria dysfunction and is supported mainly by the change in Mitochondria intensity. Mitochondria has more common phenotype features, including fragmentation, heterogeneity in mitochondria. You are only covering mitochondria intensity which is quite vague. Try provide more detailed evidence by using CellProfiler to perform analysis.\n 2. Provide more fine-grained research on phenotype similarity between GFM1, NDUFA4, PDK3, and AFG3L2 knockouts. Try to see features where there are divergences in phenotypes to understand their different role in genetic processes. \n3. Asymmetric Dose-Response: Loss vs. Gain of Function is very interesting observation. Try to dig deeper on this, use more calculation to quantitatively support claim — Elongation is not rate-limiting under normal conditions, while other factors (ribosome assembly, initiation, termination) may be rate-limiting"
