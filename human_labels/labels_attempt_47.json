  "comments": "Suggestions on the Following Attempt: \n  1. The RNA-specific single-cell analysis for RAC1 knockout is very interesting. Perform the same analysis for RAC1 overexpression, to see the differences.\n2. Analyze what other genes behave highly similar with RAC1 on cell morphology, and analyze when this phenomenon arises in cells. \n3. More direct quantization analysis on cytoskeleton features, understand its distribution, colocalization with other cell contents. Provide direct evidence for cytoskeleton disruption. "
