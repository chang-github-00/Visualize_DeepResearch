  "comments": "Suggestions on the Following Attempt: \n1. Compare effect of FBXO5 overexpression and knockout on single-cell level. Provide more proof of evidence why FBX05 is prognosis marker for cancers. \n2. Look for more evidence of FBXO5 in the p53 related cancer pathways, compare cell phenotypes with upstream and downstream genes perturbation phenotypes. Construct the role of FBXO5 on cancer related pathways and possible therapeutic targets.\n"
