  "comments": "Major errors\n\n- Wrong / duplicated DOI: Hagenlocher et al. 2022 is listed with 10.3389/fcell.2022.794407 (that DOI belongs to the Veselá Frontiers paper), so the citation is broken.\n\n- KEGG map mismatch: “Apoptosis pathway (map04215)” vs later “map04210”; at least one is incorrect.\n\n- Internal inconsistency on imaging sites: claims 9 sites/well but analyzes 3 sites/condition (and totals align with 3), so the methods description overstates coverage.\n\nModerately Novel\n\n- The JUMP phenotype (very large density increase upon CASP8/TNFRSF10B KO) is interesting; the “paradigm-shifting constitutive DISC signaling” framing is speculative and currently overclaimed.\n\nImprovement Comments for Next Round\n\n- Re-run with full sampling (all sites/well) and report per-site distributions, not just mean ± SD; add statistical tests and plate/batch normalization details.\n\n- Rule out segmentation artifacts at high confluence: manual spot-check counts, alternative segmentation, check for merged nuclei, saturation, and cell clumping.\n\n- Disentangle proliferation vs reduced death: time course, EdU/Ki67, mitotic index, Annexin V/cleaved CASP3, cell cycle profiles.\n\n- CRISPR specificity: show multiple sgRNAs (or consensus across reagents), and rescue (WT CASP8/TNFRSF10B) plus catalytic-dead CASP8 to test enzymatic requirement.\n\n- Broaden perturbations in-pathway: FADD KO (if available), CFLAR/FLIP, RIPK1/3/MLKL context, CASP10; test whether phenotypes track pathway logic.\n\n- Test ligand dependency explicitly: TRAIL stimulation ± sensitizers; see whether OE changes sensitivity rather than baseline density.\n\n- Fix references + tone: correct DOIs/KEGG IDs; downgrade “paradigm shift” to “hypothesis generated from morphology + literature,” with clear alternative explanations."
