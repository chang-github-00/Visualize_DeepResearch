  "comments": "Suggestion for improvement:\n\n1. GCK as central for metabolic regulation and how morphology reflects mitochondrial function is very interesting. However, after knockout, the increase in mitochondria does not fully supports mitochondria stress and dysfunction and other evidences are not direct. Try to use cellprofiler and capture more features about mitochondria, to see more evidence of the dysfunction as well as how other channels capture the lack of ATP in cell. The mitochondria up regulation effect is also very interesting. Try understand it in more detailed way and combine other features to see why it exists.\n\n2. Also, you mentioned similarity to other knockout effect in metabolism related genes and transcription related genes. Perform single cell comparison to understand how and why they are similar and differences in mitochondria effect. "
