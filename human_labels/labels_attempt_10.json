  "comments": "Suggestions on the Following Attempt: \n  1. You identified ATP6V1G1 have nucleolar localization. Try segment nucleoli inside the cells and directly measure the features of nucleoli to gather more direct evidence of V-ATPase behavior.\n2. You identified possible Ribosome Biogenesis defects. Try to find direct or indirect evidence in cell painting data.\n3. Compare specific features of different V-ATPase morphology. Try to understand their similarities and differences in biological processes. \n4. Gather more direct evidence of cell death phenotype: e.g. the cell becomes very round. \n"
