  "comments": "You provided a very convincing study on UB1A knockout effect - UBA1 loss → Impaired Ubiquitination → Impaired ribosomal protein degradation → Accumulation of defective ribosomes → Nucleolar stress → p53 activation → Cell cycle arrest, a few suggestions for improvement\n\n1. Several mechanism chains are mentioned, unify them (UBA1 loss → Impaired Ubiquitination  → Protein accumulation → Cell cycle arrest / nucleolar stress / mitochondria dysfunction / DNA Damage /  ER Stress) make them more unified. \n2. The evidence chain are very good. Especially how DNA Texture InfoMeas2 reflects DNA damage, and Nucleoli per Nucleus reflects nucleolar stress. Find more features to support the hypothesis and try to be illustrative as possible in a detailed manner. \n3. Compare the similarity and differences in phenotype with UBA2 and UBA3, look at the differences in pathways and try to understand their differences. Also, compare single cell analysis with UBA1 overexpression, if exists. "
