  "comments": "Suggestions on the Following Attempt: \n  1. One important evidence is ER stress (due to ER localization and protein trafficking defects). Currently, only ER intensity is calculated. Try to calculate more features for ER to elucidate the localization (by calculating colocalization with different parts, granularity, etc.) \n2. The cytoskeleton enhancement is very interesting. It can be seen from the FDPS overexpression data, there are two different spikes for cytoskeleton intensity. It would be interesting to cluster and classify cells into different cell types and analyze the differences. \n3. Mitochondria dysfunction has more common phenotype features, including fragmentation, heterogeneity in mitochondria. You are only covering mitochondria intensity which is quite vague. Try provide more detailed evidence.\n4. Provide more detailed research on phenotype similarity and differences with other mevalonate pathway genes.\n"
