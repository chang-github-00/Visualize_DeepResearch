  "comments": "Suggestions on the Following Attempt: \n1. You identified SOX5 as the key transcription factor, which is supported by increase RNA intensity after SOX5 overexpression. Please analyze more features on SOX5 transcription effects, including changes in RNA textures, localization. \n2. There are many genes from the SOX family (e.g. SOX6, SOX9), as well as other upstream and downstream targets. Analyze and compare their functions with SOX5 to understand more about its pathways.\n3. Compare effect of SOX5 overexpression and knockout on single-cell level. "
