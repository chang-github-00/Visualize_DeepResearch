  "comments": "Suggestions on the Following Attempt: \n  1. One claim Cytoskeleton-Mitochondria Coupling is not well supported by direct evidence. Try to calculate colocalization metrics for more direct evidence. \n2. Comparison with other Focal Adhesion Pathway genes is extremely crucial as this denotes whether this phenotype change is specific to focal adhesion or might be phenotype of other processes. Perform single-cell analysis on upstream and downstream genes and compare their phenotypes. \n"
