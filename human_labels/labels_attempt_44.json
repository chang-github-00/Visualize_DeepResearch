  "comments": "Suggestions on the Following Attempt: \n  1. One claim Cytoskeleton-Mitochondria Coupling is not well supported by direct evidence. Try to calculate colocalization metrics for more direct evidence. Draw Hexbin colocalization plot for better visualization. \n2. Comparison with other Focal Adhesion Pathway genes is extremely crucial as this denotes whether this phenotype change is specific to focal adhesion and its relationship to cell migrating mobility or might be phenotype of other processes. Perform single-cell analysis on upstream and downstream genes and compare their phenotypes. \n3. Change the focus on the report not to the single gene ITGAV but rather a study on general focal adhesion phenotypes within the family. What is the common phenotype after knockout for upstream and downstream genes, and the common phenotype for over expressions? Change the title to be more broadly focused on focal adhesion phenotypes as well as glioblastoma.\n 4. In the single cell comparison, the colocalization drawing is limited to the Nuclei (DNA channel). The colocalization is more interesting within the full cell range, as we would like to see Actin structure correlation with mitochondria to understand how it shapes cell movements."
