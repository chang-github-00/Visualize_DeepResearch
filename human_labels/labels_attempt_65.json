  "comments": "1.Quantify mitochondrial and ER phenotypes: Use cellprofiler analysis to expand feature extraction to better capture mitochondrial fragmentation and network organization (e.g., branch length, node degree, aspect ratio, network entropy) and provide a more detailed ER stress characterization, including ER morphology (sheet‑to‑tubule ratio, dilation, continuity) and, if available, ER stress pathway markers.\n2.Assess consistency across more than 10 sites and wells: Verify that the F8 phenotype is reproducible across all imaging sites and wells using both visualization (per-site, and per-cell montages) and quantitative metrics to rule out site‑ or well‑specific artifacts.\n3.Improve clustering interpretability: Include representative single‑cell image crops for each cluster, highlighting the defining mitochondrial and ER features of each cell state.\n4.Compare with other genes: Identify additional genes with similar ER and mitochondrial phenotypes and test whether this effect is enriched among coagulation‑related genes, supporting a shared pathway‑level mechanism.\n5.Refine title and framing: De‑emphasize novelty of ER–mitochondria coupling and instead focus on how ER stress emerges morphologically, how it drives mitochondrial network remodeling, and how coagulation gene mutations may lead to ER dysfunction.\n"
