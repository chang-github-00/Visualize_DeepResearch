  "comments": "The hypothesis and observations on mitochondria network formation is very interesting for F8 and is novel. A few suggestions for improvement:\n1. Try to use as many descriptive features as possible to quantify and measure the mitochondrial fragmentation and network effects. \n2. Determine if the effect is common in all sites and wells for this gene. Use visualization as well as metrics to make sure of this.\n3. The clustering analysis is also very interesting. Create representative cell crops for each clustering cell type. \n4. Look for other genes that have the same effect on mitochondria similar to F8. Find if this phenotype is representative of coagulation genes. \n5. Change the title of the report. The new ER stress pathway discovered is less interesting and instead focus on some representative phenotype of a certain family of genes."
